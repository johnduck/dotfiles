# dotfiles

 My personal configurations for Unix-like OS. Only supports for Linux
 (with Apt package manager) and Darwin.

## How to install

 Recommend to clone this project into `~/.dotfiles`

```bash
apt update && apt install git
git clone https://github.com/sangwoo-joh/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./configure.sh
./install.ml
```
